# ML Base
Base Image for ML Development. Many images will require an appropriate GPU and the [Cuda container toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html) properly configured in order for them to work.

Getting an Machine Learning environment just right can be a huge hassle, with docker we can figure out how an environment should look and then make it portable.
